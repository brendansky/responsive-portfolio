            I never know what to write in places like this, so of course I've put this section off until the very end. I've been tinkering with these pages for the past few hours and I am in a state of grim satisfaction. I see many things that I would like to fix, and I know that I could fix them with more time, but alas. The biggest issue I've had is with alignement. I wrote the css piece by piece, trying to make each element fit one by one. In hindsight my folly was obvious, but it seems the chance to begin anew has passed, and I've resorted to some very inelegant solutions. Please don't resize your browser window too much.
